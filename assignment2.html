                <p>I decided to sketch the schematics separately. I think for next time I will attempt to sketch it as one schematic and include the Arduino. Along with the sketches, I calculated the resistances. I remember that the professor stated the button needs 1,000 ohms, so my math checks out.</p>

                <p>Adding the extra layer of the button, I was confused for awhile this week. A lightbulb went off when I learned that the LEDs connect to the Arduino and not the button somehow. Pin 2 basically serves as a input into the Arduino, which can detect when the button is pressed/the circuit is completed. The red LED is connected to pin 10 and the blue LED to pin 11 as outputs; the pins were chosen because they are able to output as analogWrite.</p>

// In this section, I am using constants to name my pins so that I don't get confused.
const int buttonPin = 2;     // Set pin 2 as buttonPin.
const int redLED =  10;      // Set pin 10 as redLED.
const int blueLED =  11;     // Set pin 11 as blueLED.

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // Variable for reading the pushbutton status.

void setup() {
  pinMode(redLED, OUTPUT);       // Initialize the red LED pin as an output.
  pinMode(blueLED, OUTPUT);      // Initialize the blue LED pin as an output.
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);     // Initialize the pushbutton pin as an input.
}

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);                   // Read the state of the pushbutton value.
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {                              // Check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH.
    for (int counter = 0; counter < 255; counter ++){     // For loop that starts at 0 and counts up by 1 up to 255 (for 8-bit color).
      analogWrite(redLED, counter);                       // Set the brightness of the red LED with the value supplied by the for loop.
      analogWrite(blueLED, counter);                      // Set the brightness of the blue LED with the value supplied by the for loop.
      delay(5);                                           // Delay by 5 milliseconds.
    }
  } else {                                                // If the button is not pressed and the buttonState is LOW, execute this.
      digitalWrite(redLED, HIGH);                         // Set the red LED to HIGH (maximum brightness).
      digitalWrite(blueLED, HIGH);                        // Set the blue LED to HIGH (maximum brightness).
      delay(5);                                           // Delay by 5 milliseconds.
    }

                <p>The coding was hard as well. I had to scale back. My original intention was to have the button fade in one LED, while fading out the other simultaneously; pressing it again would reverse the process. Jasper explained some of the things I needed to do and I realized I was pressed on time. I guess just fading in LEDs is cool too.</p>

                <p>Hey, it works. Can't complain. The fading in doesn't look obvious, but it's there.</p>
