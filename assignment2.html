                <h3>Schematic</h3>

                <p>I decided to sketch the schematics separately. I think for next time I will attempt to sketch it as one schematic and include the Arduino. Along with the sketches, I calculated the resistances. I remember that the professor stated the button needs 1,000 ohms, so my math checks out.</p>

                <h3>Circuit</h3>

                <p>Adding the extra layer of the button, I was confused for awhile this week. A lightbulb went off when I learned that the LEDs connect to the Arduino and not the button somehow.</p>

                <pre>
void setup() {
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);       // initialize digital pin 13 as an output
pinMode(12, OUTPUT);       // initialize digital pin 12 as an output
pinMode(11, OUTPUT);       // initialize digital pin 11 as an output
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);    // turn the red LED (pin 13) on by making the voltage HIGH
digitalWrite(12, HIGH);    // turn the green LED (pin 12) on by making the voltage HIGH
digitalWrite(11, HIGH);    // turn the blue LED (pin 11) on by making the voltage HIGH
delay(500);                // wait for half a second
digitalWrite(13, LOW);     // turn the red LED (pin 13) off by making the voltage LOW
digitalWrite(12, LOW);     // turn the green LED (pin 12) off by making the voltage LOW
digitalWrite(11, LOW);     // turn the blue LED (pin 11) off by making the voltage LOW
delay(500);                // wait for half a second
}
                </pre>
                <p>The coding was hard as well. I had to scale back. My original intention was to have the button fade in one LED, while fading out the other simultaneously; pressing it again would reverse the process. Jasper explained some of the things I needed to do and I realized I was pressed on time. I guess just fading in LEDs is cool too.</p>

                <p>Hey, it works. Can't complain. The fading in doesn't look obvious, but it's there.</p>
