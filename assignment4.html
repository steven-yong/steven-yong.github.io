                <p>I only calculated the values for the minimum resistance of the photoresistor because that is when it could pose a danger to my Arduino microcontroller. The calculations confirm that using a 10K Ohm resistor is safe. My calculations for the LED strip showed that without any resistors it would fry my Arduino to oblivion, so I calculated the current using a 10K Ohm resistor and it pushes it into safe territory. The volts is also safe since the maximum for the Arduino Uno R3 is exactly 12. This week I was initially overwhelmed with the math of the LED strip, but taking it one step at a time I think I was able to work through it correctly with the help of Google. Snow got in the way of office hours this week, so hopefully Jasper or Kartika can answer two questions I had about this the next time I see them.</p>

                <p>The coding was pretty quick this week since it's last week's code, but simpler since I'm not using an RGB.</p>
